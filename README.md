# Dreidel
a simulation of dreidel, a Jewish game played during Hanukkah

## Description
With this dreidel simulator, you can observe a game of dreidel with a virtually unlimited number of players
and your own custom piece settings (currency type, quantity in game). The distribution of pieces will occur
based on a random result from each dreidel spin and its subsequent repercussions. As you progress
through the rounds, place your bet as to who will be the last player standing!
